# Xenon

A sort-of replacement for GameLauncher.exe. (GMS MapleStory)


## Features

* Launches the game without Nexon Launcher.


## Caveats

* Cannot patch the game at the moment (highly doubt this will be implemented, just too much work - go use Nexon Launcher tbh. Xenon really is designed to be used to just quickly switch accounts like last time)

Nexon - if you don't like this software, please contact me via email or Twitter instead of banning me or whatever, and I will happily get it resolved ASAP (take down the repo, whatever).
